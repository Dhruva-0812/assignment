4)task2-assignment-2:-
here the compiler takes in an number from the user.
The compiler then applies a for loop from the range 0 to a+1. Here first the condition is checkedif the condition is true then the number is added to the sum. then 1 is added to that number and then the new number is used to check the condition if satisified then the loop repeats till a then when the new number becomes a+1 it exits the loop. Then using this sum we print the  sum.
